    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously
        cheesy
        filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a
        blend of
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
        crusty
        garlic bread.</p>
    <p>Homemade lasagna isn't as hard to make as it seems. Don't be intimidated by all the layers of delicious Italian
        flavor —
